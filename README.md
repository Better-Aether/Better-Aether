# Better Aether
Hello and welcome to the Better Aether project's page, aimed to provide you with information as to what's this bizarre fork.

Better Aether is a fork of <a href="https://git.gildedgames.com/GildedGames/Aether-II">Aether II</a> intended to port many of the <a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1275355">Aether Collaboration Mod</a>'s features to Aether II, often further improving them, while keeping the fresh feeling Aether II gives.

Under this line is given the original README.md of Aether II as of 2017-02-26 UTC.
