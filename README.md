**ATTENTION:** This availability is intended for programmers and early adopters only. In its current state, the Aether Rewrite isn't suitable for public use or human consumption. Things are missing, broken, and subject to major change. **Proceed with caution.**

### For early adopters
Please keep in mind that the Aether is currently undergoing rapid development, which means you might run into some show stopping bugs.

We ask that you have existing knowledge of Minecraft modding, locating crash reports, editing configuration files, and a bit of patience if you're wishing to report issues or contribute back.

### For developers
When contributing source code changes to the Aether, it is **mandatory** to keep consistent use of the formatting templates found in `code_formatters/`.

### Permissions
You are free to upload or share any commentary, screenshots, videos, or anything else you make of the Aether II Rewrite. Go for it!

However, **you are not permitted to redistribute compiled builds** of the Aether Rewrite. This includes builds that have been released by Gilded Games publicly or for patrons, and builds you have compiled from the Git repository.
