### Creating issues
We ask that you kindly search for issues that may be similar to yours before opening a new issue. Here's a handy guide to creating top-notch issues!

- Provide the exact steps required to reproduce your issue.

- If your issue is a bug, please state what you expected to happen.

- If your issue is a crash, attach the latest client/server log and crash report.

- If your issue only occurs with other mods/plugins installed, please list the exact mod/plugin versions installed.

You should keep your issue description clear and concise. Your issue's title should also be easy to digest, giving our developers a good idea of what's wrong without including too many details. 

### Creating merge requests
When contributing source code changes to the Aether, it is **mandatory** to keep consistent use of the formatting templates found in `code_formatters/`.

Furthermore, your merge request should contain the following details:

- An overview of the changes your merge request makes.

- A link to an open issue your merge request resolves, if applicable.

Due to the rapid development pace of the Aether Rewrite, we're currently not accepting merge requests of which are purely content additions.
